<hr />
<h3>6 months ago we were assigned a project, to explore a passion per se </h3>
<h3>I chose digital art, my goal was to combat my perfectionistic tendencies, when it comes to thhings I make.</h3>
<h3>Im not entirely sure how sucessful my goal or project was, due to the fact digital art takes a lot of time I didnt have at the time, ballencing work and school took up way more time then I had Intially thought</h3>
<h3>during the 6 months I started a few artworks, made a few songs, and this website.</h3>
<h3>So I guess the project wasnt an entire failure I did learn how to deal and work arround amy perfectionistic tendencies</h3>
<h3> This website deals as a medium to share my thoughts, problems, and progress with this progect</h3>
