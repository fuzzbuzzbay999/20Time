    <hr>
    <h3> my project has finished, it was far from what I had planned for it to be, I had expected for a large portfolio showing my progress.
        However as yall can see it is not such, and I am okay with that.
    </h3>
    <hr>
    <h2> my goal was to combat and over come my perfectionistic tendencies</h2>
    <h3>I did it, WOOOOOO!!!!!!</h3>
    <h2> lets discuss some failures</h2>
    <h3> First off I got way to over ambitious I was not ready for the work load required to complete my vision.<br>
        Second, I did not do to great of a job at time management aspect of the project, .</h3>
<h2>lets discus some successes</h2>
<h3>some major sucesses are I am able to fuction and be alright with what I create even if it wasn't what I had initially hoped or thought of.<br>
    I have actually learned some things about the creative process</h3>

<h3>
my portfolio consists of some sketches and a few songs, ive made. I dabled in 3d with blender and maya, but that was for other things so I won't count it, in my portfolio. 
    <br>
    it isnt much but I think its enough, to demonstrate the completion of my goals.
</h3>
<h3> I used krita for the sketches and fl studio for the songs.</h3>
<h3> Twards the middle of the project, I was loosing steam, I mainly delt with it by occupying my time with other work. To get my mind off things, and manage the stress of perfection, and forced progress.</h3>
